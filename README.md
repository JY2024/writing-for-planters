# Writing For Planters

What is a "planter"? Some writers are "plotters" who create outlines before writing. Some writers are "pantsers" who write by the seat of their pants. A "planter" falls in between. Writing For Planters is a desktop app with features designed for this style of writing and work flow.

Language: Python

Made with PyQt5 and PyDrive.

## Instructions
Without GDrive upload functionality: download from Releases.

With GDrive upload functionality: download files, obtain a client_secrets.json from Google's API Console (make sure you add yourself as a permitted user if in test mode), move client_secrets.json to the project directory, run main.py. From here, you can create an executable for simpler usage if you want to.
